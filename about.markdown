## **Hi; my name is Matthew Apuya.**
{: style="text-align: center;"}
I'm a student currently living in New York City. I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before moving to Little Rock, Arkansas, where I graduated from Pulaski Academy in 2019. Currently, I attend New York University studying Computer Science (hopefully with a minor in Data Science and Game Design). That being said, I remain passionate about film and photography.
